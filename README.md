Client mod for the Archipelago multiworld randomizer.

## TODO list
### APWorld
- FEATURE:       Include building variants in logic (look at client mod)
- GOOD LOOKING:  Rewrite region connections to official method
- FEATURE:       Most vanilla options preset
### Client mod
- IMPORTANT:     Rewrite progress saving to instead resyncing
- FEATURE:       Replace seed from save file with apworld-generated seed
- FEATURE:       Text box (read only), received non-progression items only there
- FEATURE:       Disconnect from AP server when returning to main menu
- FEATURE:       Save login details in save files and automatically connect, connecting in main menu overwrites login details
- FEATURE:       Save all slot data in save file
- FEATURE:       Offline playing
- FEATURE:       Make building variants placable without base variant (look at apworld)
- FEATURE:       Make same color at random shape generator more often
- FEATURE:       Automate saving/loading hubgoal reward
- FEATURE:       Randomize blueprint shape
- FEATURE:       make buildings traps only affect unlocked ones
- FEATURE:       Scout location before sending
- FEATURE:       Details when checking Level location, custom hubGoal reward, override hud
- FEATURE:       Details for received items (player, location)
### Both
- FEATURE:       Achievements
- FEATURE:       Add bounty goal: collect mcguffins, enough of them give a hint towards bounty (always shapesanity stitched mixed), checking that gives bounty item, which sends goal
- FEATURE:       Need some ideas for expanding upgrade requirements
- FEATURE:       Buildings functionality randomization, like malfunctioning trap, but permanent
