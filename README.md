Client mod for the Archipelago multiworld randomizer.

## TODO list
### APWorld

### Client mod
- FEATURE:       Replace seed from save file with apworld-generated seed

- FEATURE:       Text box (read only), received non-progression items only there
- FEATURE:       Disconnect from AP server when returning to main menu

- FEATURE:       Make same color at random shape generator more often
- FEATURE:       Automate saving/loading hubgoal reward
- FEATURE:       Randomize blueprint shape
- FEATURE:       make buildings traps only affect unlocked ones
- FEATURE:       Wires still blocked until vanilla unlock?
- FEATURE:       Scout location before sending
- FEATURE:       Details when checking Level location, custom hubGoal reward, override hud
- FEATURE:       Details for received items (player, location)
### Both
- FEATURE:       Add shapesanity goal
- FEATURE:       Add locked belt/extractor option
- FEATURE:       Need some ideas for expanding upgrade requirements
- FEATURE:       More randomized level and upgrade logic types
