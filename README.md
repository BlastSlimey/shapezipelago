Client mod for the Archipelago multiworld randomizer.

## TODO list
### APWorld
- BEFORE PR:    Include building variants in logic (look at client mod)
- GOOD LOOKING: Rewrite region connections to official method, simplify connections
- BEFORE PR:    Most vanilla options preset
- IMPORTANT:    Complete Shapesanity
- BEFORE PR:    Split Inventory Drain Trap option
### Client mod
- FEATURE:      Replace seed from save file with apworld-generated seed
- FEATURE:      Text box (read only), received non-progression items only there
- FEATURE:      Disconnect from AP server when returning to main menu
- FEATURE:      Save login details in save files and automatically connect, connecting in main menu overwrites login details

- FEATURE:      Make same color at random shape generator more often
- FEATURE:      Randomize blueprint shape

- BEFORE PR:    Details for received items (player, location)
### Both
- BEFORE PR:    Achievements
- FEATURE:      Add bounty goal: collect mcguffins, enough of them give a hint towards bounty (always shapesanity stitched mixed), checking that gives bounty item, which sends goal
- FEATURE:      Need some ideas for expanding upgrade requirements
- FEATURE:      Buildings functionality randomization, like malfunctioning trap, but permanent
- FEATURE:      Extra mod file for instant offline
### Labels
- IMPORTANT:    Text
- GOOD LOOKING: Text
- FEATURE:      Text
