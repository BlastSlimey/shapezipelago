Client mod for the Archipelago multiworld randomizer.

## TODO list
### APWorld
### Client mod
- IMPORTANT:    register achievements by hand
- Needed for 1.0 release:
  - Replace seed from save file with apworld-generated seed
  - Text box (read only), received non-progression items only there
  - Disconnect from AP server when returning to main menu
  - Save login details in save files and automatically connect, connecting in main menu overwrites login details
  - Save all slot data in save file
  - Offline playing
  - Randomize blueprint shape
  - Details when checking Level location, custom hubGoal reward, override hud  
### Both
- FEATURE:      Add bounty goal: collect mcguffins, enough of them give a hint towards bounty (always shapesanity stitched mixed), checking that gives bounty item, which sends goal
- FEATURE:      Need some ideas for expanding upgrade requirements
- FEATURE:      Buildings functionality randomization, like malfunctioning trap, but permanent
### Labels
- IMPORTANT:    Text
- GOOD LOOKING: Text
- FEATURE:      Text
- BEFORE PR:    Text
