Client mod for the Archipelago multiworld randomizer.

## TODO list
### APWorld
- Web docs
- Item descriptions
- Location descriptions
- Include building variants in logic (look at client mod)
### Client mod
- Replace seed from save file with apworld-generated seed
- Achievements
- Text box (read only), received non-progression items only there
- Disconnect from AP server when returning to main menu
- Save login details in save files and automatically connect, connecting in main menu overwrites login details
- Save all slot data in save file
- Offline playing
- Make building variants placable without base variant (look at apworld)
- Make same color at random shape generator more often
- Automate saving/loading hubgoal reward
- Randomize blueprint shape
- make buildings traps only affect unlocked ones
- Wires still blocked until vanilla unlock?
- Save shapesanity analysis in cache
- Scout location before sending
### Both
- Rename upgrade categories
- Add shapesanity goal
- Add locked belt/extractor option
- Need some ideas for expanding upgrade requirements
- Trap to make buildings produce wrong items
- More randomized level and upgrade logic types
- Fix Rotater/Rotator misspelling (correct is Rotator according to Google Translate, but vanilla code says Rotater
### Other
- Mod showcase in developer discord
