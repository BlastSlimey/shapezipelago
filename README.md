Client mod for the Archipelago multiworld randomizer.

## TODO list
### APWorld
- IMPORTANT:     Web docs
- IMPORTANT:     Item descriptions
- IMPORTANT:     Location descriptions
- FEATURE:       Include building variants in logic (look at client mod)
- GOOD LOOKING:  Remove "option".value on comparisons

- GOOD LOOKING:  Rich text for some optionsw
### Client mod
- FEATURE:       Replace seed from save file with apworld-generated seed
- FEATURE:       Achievements
- FEATURE:       Text box (read only), received non-progression items only there
- FEATURE:       Disconnect from AP server when returning to main menu
- FEATURE:       Save login details in save files and automatically connect, connecting in main menu overwrites login details
- FEATURE:       Save all slot data in save file
- FEATURE:       Offline playing

- FEATURE:       Make same color at random shape generator more often
- FEATURE:       Automate saving/loading hubgoal reward
- FEATURE:       Randomize blueprint shape
- FEATURE:       make buildings traps only affect unlocked ones
- FEATURE:       Wires still blocked until vanilla unlock?
- FEATURE:       Save shapesanity analysis in cache
- FEATURE:       Scout location before sending
- FEATURE:       Details when checking Level location, custom hubGoal reward, override hud
- FEATURE:       Details for received items (player, location)
### Both
- FEATURE:       Add shapesanity goal
- FEATURE:       Add locked belt/extractor option
- FEATURE:       Need some ideas for expanding upgrade requirements
- FEATURE:       More randomized level and upgrade logic types
- GOOD LOOKING:  Fix Rotater/Rotator misspelling (correct is Rotator according to Google Translate, but vanilla code says Rotater)
