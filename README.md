Client mod for the Archipelago multiworld randomizer.

## TODO list
### APWorld
- TestBase
- Web docs
- Item descriptions
- Location descriptions
- Include building variants in logic (look at client mod)
- Spoiler doc path generation
- earlier balancer tunnel trash option (complete random, five buildings, three buildings, sphere 1)
### Client mod
- Replace seed from save file with apworld-generated seed
- Achievements
- Text box (read only), received non-progression items only there
- Disconnect from AP server when returning to main menu
- Save login details in save files and automatically connect, connecting in main menu overwrites login details
- Save all slot data in save file
- Make building variants placable without base variant (look at apworld)
- Make same color at random shape generator more often
- Automize saving/loading hubgoal reward
- Expand shapesanity 2-1 (unordered), 1-1 (ordered), one-colored full subshape, one-subshape full colored
### Both
- Rename upgrade categories
- Add shapesanity goal
- Add locked belt/extractor option
- Add randomize level checking option (bool), amount/throughput rate option (range 0-100)
- Need some ideas for expanding upgrade requirements
